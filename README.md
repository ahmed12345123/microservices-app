Project: .NET Microservices Web Application with Kubernetes & DevOps Tooling

Designed and implemented a cloud-native microservices web application using .NET Core, containerized with Docker, and orchestrated via Kubernetes. This project demonstrates key DevOps practices and technologies for building scalable, distributed systems.

Architecture: Built on a microservices architecture with services communicating via gRPC and Protocol Buffers for efficient inter-service communication.

API Gateway: Configured NGINX Ingress Controller as the API gateway to manage and route external traffic to services securely and efficiently.

Messaging: Integrated RabbitMQ using the Publish/Subscribe messaging pattern for asynchronous, decoupled communication between services.

Deployment: Automated deployment pipelines using YAML-based Kubernetes manifests, enabling seamless rollout and scaling of services in a cluster environment.
